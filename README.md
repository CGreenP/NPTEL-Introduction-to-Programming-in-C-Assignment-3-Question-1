NPTEL Introduction to Programming in C Assignment 3 Question 1

# Question 1
Write a C function to find the kth occurrence of an **even** integer in a sequence of non-negative integers, and then call your function from main. 

Your function should be according to the following declaration:

```int find_even(int k);```

# Input
You are given the input in two lines:

The first line contains a positive integer k. 
In the second line, you will be given a sequence of numbers. 

You have to find the kth occurrence of n in the sequence below. 

The second line consists of a sequence of non-negative integers, terminated with a -1.  The -1 is not part of the sequence.

# Output
If there are  k even numbers in the sequence, then output the  kth occurrence of even in the sequence. Otherwise, output a -1.

Sample Input
```sh
2
1 1 3 2 3 4 1 -1
```

Sample Output
```sh
4
```

# Sample input 1
```sh
2 
1 1 2 3 3 -1

# Sample output 1
```sh
-1
```

# Sample input 2
```sh
2 
2 1 1 2 3 3 -1
```

# Sample output 2
```sh
2
```

# Sample input 3
